Title : Introduction

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides By the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will Shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children And I will strike down upon thee
With great vengeance and furious anger Those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know my name is the paco When I lay my kimchi upon thee
